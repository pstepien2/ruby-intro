# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 3-arrays.rb

# Arrays are lists of things
favorite_foods = ["tacos", "burritos", "nachos"]
# puts favorite_foods.inspect

numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
# puts numbers.inspect

mixed_array = ["tacos", 12, true]
# puts mixed_array.inspect

shopping_lists = [["milk", "eggs", "toilet paper"], ["soap", "shampoo"]]
# puts shopping_lists.inspect

# Accessing the array
# puts favorite_foods[0]

# puts shopping_lists[1][1].inspect

# Add to the array

    #Add single item
#favorite_foods.push("more tacos")

    #Redeclare variable to be original plus some additional values
#favorite_foods = favorite_foods + ["fries", "ramen"]

#puts favorite_foods.inspect

# There are lots of fun things you can do with arrays:
#puts favorite_foods.count
