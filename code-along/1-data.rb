# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 5
#puts 3

# Perform simple math with numbers
#puts 5*3
#puts 5.0/3.0

# Strings
#puts "Hello, world!"

# Combine strings together
#puts "Tacos " + "are awesome"
#puts "tacos" + 3.to_s

# Variables
# food = "tacos"
# puts food

# x = 5
# y = 3
# puts x+y

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "#{x} tacos"
# puts "#{x+y} tacos"

# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".length
# puts "How are you today?".upcase
# puts "computers are hard".reverse
